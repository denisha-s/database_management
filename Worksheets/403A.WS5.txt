1. headquarters
2. label->headquarters will move to the separate table

3. artist->type

4. 
round 1:
choose artist -> type
artist+ = { artist, type }

X = { artist }
Y = artist+ = {artist, type}
Z = R - X - Y = { album, year, number, track }

R1 = X u Y = {artist, type}
artist -> type
key: artist
R1 is in BCNF

R2 = X u Z = { artist, album, year, number, track }
key: artist, album, year, number, track
artist, album -> year
album, year -> artist
R2 is NOT in BCNF

round 2: decompose R2
FD: artist, album -> year
{artist, album}+ = {artist, album, year} 

X = { artist, album }
Y = {artist, album, year}
Z = R2 - X - Y = { number, track}

R3 = X u Y = {artist, album, year}
artist, album -> year
album, year -> artist
key: artist, album
key2: album, year
R3 is BCNF

R4 = X u Z = {artist, album, number, track }
no FDs
key has to be all attributes
key: artist, album, number, track
R4 is BCNF

round 3? try to decompose R3
{artist, album}+ = {artist, album, year}
get back same three.
=> two keys


R becomes R1, R3, R4.
