1. Denisha Saviela, Kirana Irfano
2. Step 2 was a little confusing since it asked for a case statement. Since we're building our schedule for this semester I was confused about
how to form the case statement, but it became a little more clear after reading some ED discussions. In step 5, adding a foreign key was also a 
bit confusing since I don't fully understand the concept and syntax of foreign key.
3. I did not like how long this lab was. There were a lot of steps to follow. I liked how descriptive some of the steps were, but there were some
steps that could have a more clear description.
4. I spent a couple of days on the assignment, going back and forth.
