Schema:
    R = {rider, payment, driver, car, start, end, miles, fare}

Dependencies:
    {rider}→{payment}
    {driver}→{car}
    {start, end}→{miles, fare}
    {fare}→{miles}

Step 1
    1. Starting schema: R
    2. Decompose on {fare}→{miles}
    3. Results
        R1 = {rider, payment, driver, car, start, end, fare}, key = rider, driver
        R2 = {fare, miles}, key = fare
        SQL:
            CREATE TABLE R1 AS SELECT 
                rider, payment, driver, car, start, end, fare FROM R;
            ALTER TABLE R1 ADD CONSTRAINT R1_pkey PRIMARY KEY(rider);
            CREATE TABLE R2 AS SELECT DISTINCT fare, miles FROM R;
            ALTER TABLE R2 ADD CONSTRAINT R2_pkey PRIMARY KEY(fare);
Step 2
    1. Starting schema: R1
    2. Decompose on {rider}→{payment}
    3. Results:
        R3 = {rider, driver, car, start, end, fare}, key = rider, driver
        R4 = {rider, payment}, key = rider
        SQL:
            CREATE TABLE R3 AS SELECT 
                rider, driver, car, start, end, fare FROM R1;
            ALTER TABLE R3 ADD CONSTRAINT R3_pkey PRIMARY KEY(rider);
            CREATE TABLE R4 AS SELECT rider, payment FROM R1;
            ALTER TABLE R4 ADD CONSTRAINT R4_pkey PRIMARY KEY(rider);
            DROP TABLE R1;
Step 3
    1. Starting schema: R3
    2. Decompose on {driver}→{car}
    3. Results:
        R5 = {rider, driver, start, end, fare}, key = rider, driver
        R6 = {driver, car}, key = driver
        SQL:
        CREATE TABLE R5 AS SELECT 
            rider, driver, start, end, fare FROM R3;
        ALTER TABLE R5 ADD CONSTRAINT R5_pkey PRIMARY KEY(rider);
        CREATE TABLE R6 AS SELECT driver, car FROM R3;
        ALTER TABLE R6 ADD CONSTRAINT R6_pkey PRIMARY KEY(driver);
        DROP TABLE R3;
Step 4
1. Starting schema: R5
    2. Decompose on {start, end}→{miles, fare}
    3. Results:
        R7 = {rider, driver, start, end}, key = rider, driver
        R8 = {start, end, miles, fare}, key = start, end
        SQL:
        CREATE TABLE R7 AS SELECT rider, driver, start, end FROM R5;
        ALTER TABLE R7 ADD CONSTRAINT R7_pkey PRIMARY KEY(rider);
        CREATE TABLE R8 AS SELECT start, end, miles, fare FROM R5;
        ALTER TABLE R8 ADD CONSTRAINT R8_pkey PRIMARY KEY(start, end);
        DROP TABLE R5;
