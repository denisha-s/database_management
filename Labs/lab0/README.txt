2. For this lab I changed my password through the installed psql on isengard. 
For steps 5 through 8 I ran psql through visual studio code. I have yet to explore psql web.
3. One of the challenges I encountered was my personal computer not responding to psql properly.
Another challenge, or rather misunderstanding on my part, was creating the empty text file. I was working
on the lab before understanding that we had to install visual studio code, so I thought creating the text file 
needed a command similar to linux.
4. I like how some of the steps were detailed enough to follow through. I also liked how each haiku was different
from everyone else, but this isn't related too much about completing this lab.
5. After finding out we had to use visual studio code, I did not take long to finish this lab.
