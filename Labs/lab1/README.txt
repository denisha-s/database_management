2. The quetions for joining tables required a bit more work, obviously, but I had to think which column in one table should join
one column in another table. It wasn't too hard to figure out; it just required a bit more thinking. Tables that had certin NULL values
needed different syntax which also required some configuration.
3. I like how we're learning about SQL progressively by writing simple SELECT statements and using that same SELECT statements to use
JOIN statements. This assignment was a good introduction to these topics.
4. This assignment almost took the whole day. I didn't work on this assignment without breaks, but if you combine the hours it might've
taken a whole day.
5. All the data in each table seem to be accurate and enough to make connections with each table.
