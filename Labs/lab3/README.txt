2. One of the challenges I encountered was creating the cardinality relationships for the entities.
I overthought on a lot of them and struggled what "point of view" should I be looking at. Since there
were multiple right answers, it made me nervous if my answer was one of them, but I did my best in explaining
why I choose that type of relationship with that entity.
3. Overall, I liked the project. Making the script based of our own ERD was fun. Although, there was multiple
right answers, which made me nervous, I liked the freedom we had in creating the ERD.
